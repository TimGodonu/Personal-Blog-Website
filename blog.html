          We promise that there is no typo on the price. Someone just won the auction on Bring a Trailer for $50,000 even. The car in question has 5,600 miles on the odometer and will now be going to its third owner. It’s about as perfect as it gets from an aesthetic and mechanical standpoint, though it does have an unsightly aftermarket Pioneer head unit installed in the dash.

        <blockquote>That trim is a great step up in performance over a base Integra, and a few easy mods gets it close to the Type R from a performance standpoint. You won’t have the cache and bragging rights that come with the R, but you also won’t be afraid to put miles on it for fear of entirely ruining the car’s value. Happy Honda hunting.</blockquote>

          We’re still rather flabbergasted and slightly upset the original buyer only managed 6,000 miles <em>over the approximately 22 years of ownership, but the new owner could fix that quickly.</em> Then again, this could be a purely speculative buy, aiding heavily in the final gavel price.<strong>Wait a few months to a year, and the value of this unmolested Type R could increase another $10,000, or more if you don’t add miles.</strong>. It was only a year ago to date that we wrote in near-shock about a Type R with even fewer miles (1,200) going for $63,800.

            Will there come a day when an Integra Type R hits the six-digit mark? At this rate it doesn’t look far away. If you want a whole lot of what the Type R offers, without the eye-watering markup, take a long, hard look at the Integra GS-R. That trim is a great step up in performance over a base Integra, and a few easy mods gets it close to the Type R from a performance standpoint. You won’t have the cache and bragging rights that come with the R, but you also won’t be afraid to put miles on it for fear of entirely ruining the car’s value. Happy Honda hunting..
